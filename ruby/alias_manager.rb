#The first time i did this it was entirely too complicated. 
#this time it will all be one big loop, pressing enter (having an empty input) will break the loop
  #First ask for input. continue to ask untill input is empty, break loop and printing the list of alias names
  #for edge cases, each one will be taken care of on it's own. 
  #looping thru each letter will be done with .char
  #map results to a new array
  # .join the new array char together.
